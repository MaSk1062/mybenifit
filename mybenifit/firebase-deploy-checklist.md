# Get config from Firebase Console > Project Settings > General > Your apps
```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Option 1: Use deployment script (Windows)
deploy.bat

# Option 2: Use deployment script (Linux/Mac)
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh

# Option 3: Manual deployment
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

firebase projects:list
firebase use --add

# Test locally
firebase emulators:start

# View logs
firebase functions:log
firebase hosting:history

# Rollback deployment
firebase hosting:clone mybenifit-app:live mybenifit-app:rollback
```
