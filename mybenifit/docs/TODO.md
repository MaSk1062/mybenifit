## üìù **NOTES & DECISIONS**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **State Management:** Using React Context + TanStack Query for optimal performance
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization
- **UI Framework:** shadcn/ui for consistent design system
- **Testing:** Vitest + Testing Library for comprehensive testing

### **Technical Debt**
- [x] **Color Scheme Consistency**: Successfully implemented consistent black and white theme across all components
- Some components have inline styles that should be moved to Tailwind classes
- Form validation could be more comprehensive
- Error handling needs improvement in some areas
- Some hardcoded values should be moved to configuration

### **Future Considerations**
- Consider implementing a state management library (Zustand/Redux) for complex state
- Evaluate need for GraphQL API for more complex data requirements
- Consider implementing offline-first architecture
- Plan for internationalization (i18n) support
