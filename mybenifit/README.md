## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mybenifit
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Copy your Firebase config to `src/config/firebase.ts`

4. **Firestore Security Rules**
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Users can only access their own data
       match /profiles/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       
       match /activities/{docId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
       }
       
       match /extendedActivities/{docId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
       }
       
       match /progress/{docId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
       }
       
       match /goals/{docId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
       }
       
       match /workouts/{docId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
